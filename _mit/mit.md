summary: >-
  This is a free permissive license from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
  It has only limited restrictions on reuse and has, resulting from that, a huge
  compatibility with other open-source licenses. Note that this name is ambiguous;
  the MIT licensed its software under many licenses, so the Free Software Foundation
  calls it "Expat License", as it is used for the Expat library.
