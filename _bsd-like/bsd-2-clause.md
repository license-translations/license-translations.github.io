summary: >-
  This is a version of the BSD license family, with only two clauses; the obligation of
  attribution on advertising material and the restriction on name use have been removed.
  It is only required to preserve the copyright notice, the list of conditions provided
  with the license text and the disclaimer. This version is notably used by the
  [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) project; it is why it is sometimes called
  "FreeBSD License".
